## Download
[From here](https://github.com/guidouil/TouchBarBar/releases) or clone this repo and build it with Xcode 8.1

‚ö†Ô∏è The Touch Bar Bar app requires macOS 10.12.1 or later, but there's a catch! You must have the very latest 10.12.1, with system support for the Touch Bar. If your 10.12.1 version is specifically 16B2657, you're good to go. If not, you can update to the required version [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1897?locale=en_US). You can confirm you are running 16B2657 specifically, by clicking the version number in the About this Mac panel. Also you might need the [Touch√© app](https://red-sweater.com/touche/) to emulate the Touch Bar if you did not get the new Macbook Pro yet üòâ

## Features
1. Four different drinks sounds
2. Four emoji
3. Works with the TouchBarBar macOS app to allow selection and playback of predefined drinks sounds.

## Note
If you don't have a Macbook pro with touch bar yet, you can test out the Touch Bar's first ever bar app with Xcode 8.1 and macOS Sierra.
